## Delegate:

Stake (delegate) your ADA to GREEN_ADA Pool to start earning rewards. Rewards are paid automatically and directly to your digital wallet at the end of every epoch (every 5 days). First time delegating will take 3 epochs to receive rewards (16-20 days).

Delegating your stake to a staking pool NEVER requires you to send your ADA to a third party.  Anyone asking you to send them your ADA so that they can “stake” it for you is attempting to scam you. You are able to delegate your stake to legitimate stake pools without your ADA ever leaving your own wallet. GREEN_ADA stakepool will NEVER ask you to send ADA from your wallet to any address.

You can delegate using:

* [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) (Desktop, full-node wallet, longer setup)
* [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) (Web-based, “lite” wallet, instant setup)
* [Yoroi Mobile App](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/emurgos-yoroi-cardano-wallet/id1447326389) (iOS or Android, “lite” wallet, for mobile)

## How does delegation work?

Compared to Bitcoin which is based on "Proof of Work" methodology, and requires a lot of energy, Cardano uses the "Proof of Stake" methodology. In simple words, in a "Proof of Stake" the pools having a high stake will have a high chance to mint blocks. The stake depends on how much the community delegates to a pool. Delegation is a kind of Voting but you don't transfer any crypto currency. more info [here](https://cardano.org/ouroboros#proof-of-stake)


## Can I lose any money?
No. Since no ADA is transferred you cannot lose it and it always stays  safe with you in your wallet.
